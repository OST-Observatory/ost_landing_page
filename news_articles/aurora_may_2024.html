            <h1>Aurora Borealis over Potsdam on May 11, 2024</h1>
            <p>The Aurora Borealis, or Northern Lights, is a spectacular natural light display in the night sky, seen primarily in high-latitude regions. These lights are caused by collisions between charged particles from the Sun, primarily electrons, and the Earth's atmosphere. These particles are part of the solar wind, a stream of charged particles emitted by the Sun that interacts with the Earth's magnetic field. These particles are directed by the magnetic field toward the poles, where they collide with gases in the atmosphere, exciting the atoms and causing them to emit the light we see as auroras.</p>
            <p>For the aurora to be visible at lower latitudes, special conditions must be present. Most importantly, there must be increased solar activity, such as solar flares or coronal mass ejections, which increase the number of charged particles reaching Earth. This is exactly what happened in the days leading up to May 11, 2024, when Active Region 3664 produced several solar flares of varying intensity, with no less than five coronal mass ejections heading toward Earth, causing a rare G5 geomagnetic storm in Earth's protective magnetic bubble. This was the strongest geomagnetic storm since the Halloween storms of 2003, which caused power outages in Canada. More auroras are expected in the next month as the Sun moves toward the peak of its current solar activity cycle - Solar Cycle 25 - which is expected to peak sometime next year.</p>
            <p>The aurora caused by this geomagnetic storm was also visible from our observatory in Potsdam and was observed by our all sky camera as well as some of our Fabian Mattig and Florian Rünger. </p>
            <p>The colors of the aurora depend on the type of gas involved in the collisions and the altitude at which these collisions occur. Oxygen at high altitudes (about 200 km) produces red auroras, while at lower altitudes (about 120 km) it results in green-yellowish, the most common color. Nitrogen can contribute to blue or purplish-red hues (about 250 km). The precise mix of colors is determined by the different energy levels at which these gases emit light. This vibrant spectrum of colors, combined with the dynamic shapes and patterns of the aurora borealis, creates a mesmerizing natural phenomenon.</p>
